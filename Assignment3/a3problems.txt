CPSC 1620 - Assignment 3
(due Mon Feb 24, 23:55)


INSTRUCTIONS:

This assignment contains three problems. Please submit your source code
as follows:
- for Problem 1, write your code in a file named a3rock.cc
- for Problem 2, write your code in a file named a3sort.cc
- for Problem 3, write your code in a file named a3triangle.cc
Use the instructions from the course lab page to prepare and submit
your files using Moodle.

A) Please use your template.cc file for each of the specified files and then fill
in the required information.  An example of "Purpose:" for question 1 might be
something like: "This program plays a game of rock-paper-scissors between the
user and the computer and outputs the winner or whether or not there is a
tie."  If you do not have a template.cc file please copy the one from the
library.  The command to copy is: "cp   $L/samples/template.cc    ~/assn".
Please see Arie if you have any questions regarding this.

B) if you have variables, provide comments where you specify the
purpose for the variables. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM 1: 

Write a program that plays a single round of the Rock-paper-scissors
game. The user will play against the computer. The rules of the game
are described at: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors

A player plays by choosing one of three moves: rock, paper, or scissors. 

The program prompts the human player for her move and randomly
generates a move for the computer player. The program should output
the move for the computer player. The program then outputs the winner
of the game or if the game ends with a tie.

Please design the prompts and messages so that they are as clear and
as intuitive as possible. Think about how you are going to
represent the player moves in your program. 

To generate random moves, two statements (also called functions) are
useful:

a) rand() is an expression that returns a random value between 0 and
RAND_MAX. 
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/

b) srand(time(NULL)); which is an expression that initializes the
rand function. This statement should be executed once at the start of
the program. rand can then be used as many times as needed.
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/srand/
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time/

To use these functions, you need to include <cstdlib> and <ctime>
headers at the start of your program.



PROBLEM 2: 

Write a program that prompts the user to enter three integers in
variables a, b, and c. The program then swaps the values of the
variables a, b, and c appropriately so that a >= b >= c (according to
the mathematics interpretation of this predicate, not the C++
interpretation of the Boolean expression).

Please design your input and output according to the following
example:

Example:

Please enter three integers separated by space for a b and c: -3  9  1
The new values for a b c are: 9  1  -3

Hint: a solution exists that uses only three tests.



PROBLEM 3:

Write a program that prompts the user to enter three values allowed to
be fractional which represent the lengths of the sides of a
triangle. The program then outputs what type of triangle is obtained
that has the side lengths equal to the values entered. Four
possibilities exist:

a) the triangle cannot exist
b) the triangle is equilateral
c) the triangle is isosceles
d) the triangle is scalene

Look for the definition of scalene, isosceles, and equilateral triangles
at:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html

A triangle can be formed if the length of the sides satisfy the triangle
inequality: 
http://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/triangle-inequality-theorem.html

Hint: you can significantly reduce the number of tests needed if you
use your code for Problem 2 to swap the values for the three variables
as for Problem 2.

Please design the prompt messages and output according to the
following examples.

Examples corresponding to four runs of the program:

Please enter the length of the three sides separated by space: 12.9  10  10.1
The triangle is scalene

--

Please enter the length of the three sides separated by space: 1  10  1
The triangle cannot exist

--

Please enter the length of the three sides separated by space: 1  1  1
The triangle is equilateral

--

Please enter the length of the three sides separated by space: 1  2  2
The triangle is isosceles
